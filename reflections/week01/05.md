# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week? i feel html and css went smooth as it should because of the pre course work. bootstrap on the other hand was a little different. with how we have used it the last few days im getting much better at. it just takes time and experience to learn.
- What did you learn as a shock or suprise? using html css and bootstrap all in one project was actually easier than i thought. i have made mistakes for sure but after a little break they were simple mistakes.
- What are you struggling with? struggling with some of the placements of bootstrap properties. but with a little experimenting i can get it figured out
- What would you count as a victory? i just finished my check point with a bonus page that im proud of. got much more familiar with bootstrap the last few days.
