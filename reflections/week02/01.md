## Questions

1. What is Scope ?

scope means where variables are available to use. globaly accessable variables are typically at the top of the page and referenced as needed. local scope is inside of the function and can be manipulated within both have there place within javascript. 

2. What is Hoisting ?

hoisting refers to the keyword/ variable var. once var is used it will be refered in another function even if its used in a function. var in a sense will always be global and can get confusing when trying to reference it later. that is why let and const were made. 

3. In what cases might you use let vs const vs var?

let is now the most common way to declare a variable. it can be declared and re-declared when needed without having the hoisting issue. const is used when you want a variable to stay unchanged and always stay the same. var isnt used much now adays and has its issues. var is mainly globaly scoped and can be used anywhere.
