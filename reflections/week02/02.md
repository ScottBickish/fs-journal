## Questions

1. What are the three ways to syntactically write a function? What are the differences in how the function acts (if any)?

A Function Declaration defines a named function, A Function Expressions defines a named or anonymous function, and An Arrow Function Expression is a shorter syntax for writing function expressions

2. What is the difference between Parameters and Arguments?

parameters act like a place holder for data. they go in the parenthesses of the function. they can hold any type of data. arguments use the parameters to complete the function and can be changed to change the outcome of the function.

3. What are higher order functions? Can you provide an example?

higher order functions are functions that take other functions as arguments known as callback functions.
ex: let arr = [1, 2, 3, 4]
arr.map(n => n * 2)
return arr everything should be doubled in the array
