## Questions

1. What are the main ways to write information to the console? Why/when should you use each style.

the main way to write in the console is to write a console.log(). by doing this you can check to see if your js file is connected correctly, check is functions are working the right way. the console will also let you know of most errors and tell you where they are. 

2. Which tab allows you to see the breakdown of HTML/CSS and how can this tab be useful when debugging HTML?

after right clicking and selecting inspect, select the elements tab. by doing that you can see all the elements in you html and css files, select them and modify them to see differnces instead of toggling back and forth and refreshing.

3. Outside of writing everything to the console, what is a better way to debug your code?

specifically js use the debugger tag. it will pause the code and you can select to go step by step and see every little detail in how your code id working and will stop if there is an issue. i havent used it much yet but it is a very useful tool.
