## Questions

1. What problem does using exports solve?

by using exports it keeps your code safer for possible "hackers" if you will from accessing your code and tmmpering with it and using it to their advantage. another way of saying it is exports makes your code privite and inaccessable.

2. How does export differ from export default?

if you do not import your export file where you want it, the file is only locally available to that module. by default the file cannot be accessed in any other js file. 

3. What is a benefit of using the Module System?

the module system is a way to declutter your code and only use it where needed. other modules can be exported into a controller where it gets imported and used as needed. with this system it keeps your code clean and more accessible. still confusing to me but im starting to get the concept.
