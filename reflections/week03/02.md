## Questions

1. What is the purpose of Encapsulation?

using encaplulation prevents users to directly manipulate your code and offers a layer of protection. if anything is exposed in the console it is only a copy of the code. not the code it self. 

2. What were some of the problems with closures and the underscore prefix?

closers back in the day javascript objects and later classes did not include any mechanism for private properties. as for underscore prefixes ( ex: _draw() ) denote that this is a private data so other developers know it is private. back then even using the underscore didnt protect the data because it relys on convention not enforced true encapsulation

3. How do we create private variables in a ES6 Class? Why would you do this?

you can set variables in your app state aka proxystate which gets an idea of what that data looks like from the model. then goes to your service folder then your controller file then your main.js which takes a copy of that data not the actual data then goes to the client or view. that is encaplulation. it is data protection.
