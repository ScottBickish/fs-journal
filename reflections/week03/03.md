## Questions

1. What are the two common operations that we will set in the handler?

the 2 common operators are get and set

2. What do you have to make sure you are doing with every Get to ensure the value does not become `undefined`?

the default umplementation of the get operator is to return the value stored in that key in the object. the get operator taked in 2 parameters the object itself and the property being accessed. otherwise it will show up as undefined.

3. What are some of the benefits of the proxy object that we are using in our structure for applications?

when passing through proxy data it is only passing through a copy of it not the actual raw data of it.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment
today we got to use templates to pass our proxy through that made our lives much easier. still a little unsure how to set up without referencing but on the flip side i have code to reference.
