> **ðŸ“– [The Observer Pattern](https://codeworksacademy.com/fs-student-guide/resources/wk3/04-Observer-Pattern)**

## Questions

1. What problems does the Observer Pattern seek to solve?

it updates parts of the page in response to certain events. also it enables one-to-many data binding between elements. 

2. What are the three mechanisms of the observer pattern?

the subscribe method, the unsubscribe method, and the broadcast method. 

3. Review the code generated from the bcw-template and reflect on the proxy objects from yesterday, and your understanding of the observer pattern today. With this knowledge, explain how the magic of the bcw-template uses these two concepts to manage and update the dom.

the export const... etc looks alot like the subscribe portion of the article. that section of the export is saying only export the instance of the data not the data it self. also the unsubscribe method looks identical to how we delete data on the page example of that is greggs list with cars or houses.
