# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?

i learned alot more about the mvcs pattern it is still a new concept i am far far far from fully understanding but i can say at least i know how to use most of the tools im aware of. 

- What did you learn as a shock or suprise?

nothing specific but my all in all (not overall) understanding of a brand new way of writing javascript. im still fuzzy on a few thing but like ive said before it just takes alot of failures and practice

- What are you struggling with?

i am struggling with finding issues in general/trouble shooting. a lowercase vs an uppercase is something i struggled with this weekend for a very long time. the hardest ones for me are the ones that dont throw an error.

- What would you count as a victory?

finishing my checkpoint #3 for sure. and im here for the long haul. this weekend taught me alot of things.
