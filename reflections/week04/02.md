## Questions

1. What are the three states of a `Promise`?

pending, resolved, rejected

2. How do `promise`s seek to resolve the issues of "callback hell"?

promises now have a call back attatched to it instead of passing it this is called chaining. if you were to be just using callbacks you can find yourself in a situation called callback hell.


3. What is the difference between `.then()` and `.catch()`?

then happens when the function is successful a catch happens when a function fails and will throw an error.
