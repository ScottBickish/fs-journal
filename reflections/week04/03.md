## Questions

1. What is the purpose of `Async`/`Await`?

the purpose was to help reduce or eleminate the need for multiple callbacks and replaced them with async/await. the async/awaits are built on promises. its a simple do this and ill wait for it in the mean time do this other code. if it fails itll come back as an error in your catch.

2. What must you do in order to  `await` a promise inside of a function?

you must type async before the function so it knows this is an asyncronus code block.

3. What are some of the primary benefits of `Async`/`Await`?

the code is much simpler to read. especially when you have much more complex functions itll be easier to debug.

you are at the full mercy of the api in terms of how you will be digging into it. if or when i write my own i will be much nicer than the pokemon api for sure. all in all (not overall)
i feel alot more comfortable with api's and async code mark has done a gret job in teaching us.
