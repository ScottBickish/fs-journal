## Questions

1. What does REST stand for, and in simple terms what does it mean?

rest stands for representational state transfer. it lays out api's in a way that makes it easier to use and easier to discover.

2. What does Stateless mean?

stateless means the server does not remember anything about the user who uses the API. also it wont remember if a user has already sent a get request for the same resource in the past.

3. What URL pattern is used when writing a RESTful API?

urls should include nouns not verbs, use plural nouns only for consistency no singular nouns, use HTTP methods to operate on these resources, use HTTP response status codes to represent the outcome of operations on resources.
