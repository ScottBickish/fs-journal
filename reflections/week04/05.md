# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?

the whole process of calling api's and uploading to them cama alot easier than i thought i really enjoyed the inspire checkpoint.

- What did you learn as a shock or suprise?

acyncronous code. i watched the sent out video monday night and really understood it. of course with the rest of the week it really sunk in.

- What are you struggling with?

for some reason with any task list project i get stuck on something and its hard to move past. for example this week with inspire i wrote all the code for checking tasks and it took me a couple hours to figure out that the sand box api only accepted completed not checked. it didnt match and threw many many errors and it stumped me.

- What would you count as a victory?

this last week in general. with a new way of how to organize code with acync. i picked it up quicker than i thought. now compared to some of the new types of programing languages in the future this week was not hard. but so far with what we have learned ill take it as a win.
