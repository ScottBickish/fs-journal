## Questions

1. What is the purpose of a Query String?

A query string allows you to pass information to and from a website by simply adding, or appending, that information to the end of a url

2. What is the format of a query parameter? How does it start? How do you distinguish between one parameter and the next?

key = value, it starts after the ? in the url, if you have multiple query patameters they are separated by an & symbol indecating the request query has 2 values

3. When do you think Query parameters would be helpful when writing your server?

i think it will be important when you are writing what your server will accept or what it will reconize as an input. also the fact you can add multiple values if you want to an object.
