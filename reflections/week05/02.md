## Questions

1. What are the three types of relationships?


one-to-one, one-to-many, many-to-many

2. What are the benefits of the traditional `linking` of relationships instead of `Embedding`


embedding adds to the overall size of the array or object. over time it will start exceeding the allowed space available for said data. a more efficient way to do this is called linking. linking uses a foreign key and links the data to the data

3. What are some of the challenges faced when deciding how to manage a many-to-many relationship that ultimately drive your decision on how to create it?


there are a few ways to manage a many to many relationship db. the most effective way is to use whats called third collection embedding. this is useful particularly when you are dealing with several relationships. you are then able to effectively manage the adding and removing relationships. your decision is based on the size of the application.
