# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?

my experience with node has been good. i understand it enough to build a back end. at least in the way weve been taught. im sure there is alot more to know but im feeling comfortable.

- What did you learn as a shock or suprise?

the fact that in week 5 during our hackathon we didnt run into any major issues and the fact i remembered how to build a frontend haha. we learn so fast that in a matter of a few days you brain shifts in a different direction and stumbles over last weeks lectures. 

- What are you struggling with?

long story short is relationships. i understand one-to-many alright. but i am struggling with many-to-many. 

- What would you count as a victory?

my team of 4 developers did so well together. we made a very well working fullstack application. we worked great together and kicked butt. we worked till 1230 am and everyone was determined to finish and have a great product by the end im very proud of all of us and thankful for the help from teachers and t.a's
