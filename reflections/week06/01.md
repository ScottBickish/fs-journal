## Questions

1. What is Component based architecture?


component based architecture is the way all the data proceeds to the page. component files are where data gets injected to the page. each component has a single responsibility. meaning all the pages logic is not all in the same spot. 

2. What are some benefits of Component based architecture?


ecourages the single responsibility principle, and is the encaplulation of all tose resonsibility within that one space. also allows great separation of functions (if you will) and keeps the data clean. 

3. What are some drawbacks to Component based architecture?


it can often lead to bloated views and the possibility that readability might become degraded. although i think if your not trying to cram a bunch of code into the components it might make everythhing run more smoothly and look better in the process.
