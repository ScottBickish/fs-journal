## Questions

1. What is a nested route?


a nested route is a page within a page or a subpage. more specifically is a page where when you click somewhere it routes you to another page using a router link. 

2. When might you use a nested route? (other than the provided example)


when on a homepage once data has rendered to the screen, and you make the data selectable when clicked it could take you to a profile page that created the data you clicked on. 

3. Can you pass parameters through nested routes? When might you use them?

yes you can using useRouter and passing an id. this ensures that what you clicked on is yours specifically (if you create it that way). or if it belongs to a specific profile.

this week is hard for me but my take away is me and my partner worked great together and with the time we had left in class got data to render to the page from the api and almost got the modal fully functional to enable us to post.
