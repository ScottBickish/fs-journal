## Reflect on your partner project and answer the following questions

1. Which principles from this weeks reading did you implement?


pair programming with a partner on a checkpoint. working with an app that had decent mobile mobility. so developing with not just desktop in mind.

2. What went well this week?


i finished the checkpoint and got it passing for this weeks challenge. also learned alot about partner programming and how partner personalities are important. some personalities just dont mesh properly.

3. What would you do differently?


i would like to take more breaks. this week i really didnt take many breaks because we were behind on our project. its hard for me to step away when there is so much to do in a short amount of time.
