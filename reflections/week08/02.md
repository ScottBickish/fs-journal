## Questions

1. Why is communication on a small team important?


because without good communication you will suffer the productivity portion of that. not as many people are on the same page and the whole group suffers. its important to talk things out and get an understanding of what needs to be done. 

2. What adjustments from traditional sized scrum teams need to be made to use the agile methodology effectively in a small team?


if the project is small dont put to many developers on the team, otherwise the efficientsy of the project suffers and productivity goes down. everyone needs a task and when that task is done they have it checked and move on. 

3. What is the unattainable triangle? What are the tradeoffs of each side?


three sides consist of quality speed and price. you cant have all three without affecting at least one. if you have speed the quality will decrease but the price will be low. if you have a low price the quality will be low and speed will be high. if you have high quality the speed will be low and the price will also be high.
