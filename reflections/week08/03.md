## Questions

1. What is Software Development Testing?


a test is a test on a small unit of code and should be made as simple as possible. its testing to make sure that a specific portion of your code is working like it should. 

2. What are the benefits of Testing in software development?


it allows you to test with out spinning up your application and logging in then using your app in a specific way to test a specific condition to see if it works the way you want. 

3. What are some potential drawbacks of Testing in software development?


we dont have a strong incentive to spend the additional time and effort required to run a module by itself so we fail to consider all the ways in which a module might fail and thats how we get the infamous "if works on my machine"
