## Questions

1. What are the three main types of testing we can accomplish in Vue? What does each method provide?


unit testing, component testing, and end to end testing

2. What testing method do you think is the most useful? Why?


i think depending on the size of the application unit testing is important but end to end covers pretty much everything as well. unit testing tests everything independently uncluding functions that deal with many- to - many relationships, but not as a whole. i think using both is best. i dont have much knowledge on anything other than unit testing personally.

3. What testing method do you think is the least useful? Why?

probably component testing your testing a component as a whole and i would think that if you have an issue it would be hard to track down the bug or bugs that are causing your code to crash. unit testing i think would be better but would probably take longer to sift through your code.
