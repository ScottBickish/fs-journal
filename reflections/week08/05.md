This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?

we got a solid plan for how we are going to build our project for our capstone. we started working on it on tuesday and so far havent really had any major issues.
- What did you learn as a shock or suprise?

creating a pin on a page and using it to access information that is tied to it. ive never done anything like that before but it wasnt to difficult to figure out.
- What are you struggling with?

some minor backend issues i was having was getting id's mixed up. i may have gotten a little to crazy on the populates and cluttering the results from the functions. 

- What would you count as a victory?

im really proud of our group with how we work together and troubleshoot issues as a team. im glad to have worked with the team i have. i feel we are going to have an awesome app next friday.
