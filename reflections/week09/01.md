## Questions

1. What technologies and principles are you using in your project?

we are currently using vue 3, html 5, css 3, javascript, node.js, and a RESTful api. we have implememted SCRUM to help us organize our time and current goals.

2. What went well so far?

so far the team is working well together and we have made pretty good progress. i really enjoy this project and what the end goal is.  

3. What would you do differently? Why?

i think when we have a problem we get to many chefs in the kitchen. meaning everyone has an idea and wants to help but it overwhelms who ever is on the computer. i think the way to fix this is to keep the issue local meaning who ever is working together when the issue comes up only have those partners work on it until it is fixed or if they run out of ideas.
