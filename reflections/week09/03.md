## Questions

1. What is a Base64 Encoded Image?

back in the day web browsers had heavy limits on the number of connections the could send to the server. thes meant an image heavy wevsite would need to queue up the requests and wait for the ones before to finish. base64 found a way around that by using an open http connection to deliver images directly into the html or css. 

2. What are the drawbacks of using Base64 Encoding?

now adays this almost never actually loads the image and is hard to follow in the code because the data string is just to big and clutters your code. youll have caching issues, cpu overhead, and the size of the file is quite a bit larger. 

3. Why are these drawbacks issues in this day and age versus in the past?

web browsers have become incredibly efficient in delivering many files through a single connection. this works around the limits that the base64 encoding solved. in fact means base64 does more bad than good.
