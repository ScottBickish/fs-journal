# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?

the project in all went really well. we're all very happy with the result and how everything went. im very happy with my group and progress throughout the week. 

- What did you learn as a shock or suprise?
debugging skill i learned from mick was hitting control f and search for opening and closing curly brackets. its so simple yet very effective. 

- What are you struggling with?
im not struggling with anything code related really, but im starting to think about jobs and my career moving forward and im starting to get the imposter syndrome. im worried i wont get a job right away and lose some of the knowledge i have gained over the course. this means i will be coding everyday and keep my skills to the best of my ability and continue to learn as much as i can. 

- What would you count as a victory?

so far im still in the course strike free and hope to keep it that way. im proud of myself with how much ive learned and am excited to keep learning. we finished our capstone project and am happy with the result.
