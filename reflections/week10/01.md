## Questions

1. What are the three categories of data types? How are they different?

Value type, reference type, pointer type. they are different in the way of how they store their value in memory.

2. What are the Value-type data types? What differences do you notice from JavaScript?

bool, char, decimal, double, enum, float, int, long, sbyte, short, struct, uint, ulong, ushort. there are way more number types in c# than in javascript.

3. In your own words how do Reference types get stored in memory? How does this differ from Value types?


reference types doesn't store its value directly. instead it uses something called a pointer to a specific location (address) and looks for the data there.
