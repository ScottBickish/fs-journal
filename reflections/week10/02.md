## Questions

1. What is a List in C#?


list is a generic type that can hold any type of data. whether its an int string or float.

2. What List methods seem like you might use them often? Why?


list .Add is probably going to be the method i would use alot. anytime were working with lists we are always manupulating them in many ways. also list.Remove as well as list.Find

3. How would you retrieve an item from a list? What method could you use?

depending on what your're doing list.find or list.findall. using these would find either the first instance of what you want or all instances of what you want.
