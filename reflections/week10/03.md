## Questions

1. In a SQL table, what is the difference between information in a row and information in a column?

the column holds the title of the data like for a car you would see make, model, year etc... as for the row you would see the actual data like ford, f250, 2017.

2. Demonstrate the basic structure for creating a new table called `characters` with the values `name, age, description` as strings, and an `int` id.

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS characters(
  id INT AUTO_INCREMENT NOT NULL primary key,
  name TEXT NOT NULL,
  age INT NOT NULL,
  description TEXT NOT NULL
);

3. What are the difference between the following statements: 
```sql
DELETE FROM table_name;
this delete will delete a specic object from the table usually by an id or a name.
DROP TABLE table_name;
this will delete the whole table 
```
