# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?

learning c# is hard but its still kinda familiar in terms of logic.

- What did you learn as a shock or suprise?

writing sql tables. it was a lot easier than i thought and i feel comfortable with writing in that language. 

- What are you struggling with?

identifying certain parts of the controller and the service. but mostly manipulating data to populate. im still confused on how to do that.

- What would you count as a victory?

writing in sql. like i have said before i feel pretty good writing that. though populating im confused on still but ill win where i can.
