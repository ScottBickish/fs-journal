## Questions

1. What is the difference between a `primary key` and a `foreign key`

primary key is a unique piece of data that is used to reference or identify records on a table. foreign key is used to reference another table that shares the unique data.

2. What is an `Alias`?

when joining tables when selecting from joining on you alias out what your selecting/joining. for example     
      SELECT 
        h.*,
        a.* 
      FROM habits h
      JOIN accounts a ON h.creatorId = a.id
      WHERE h.id = @id;";

3. Demonstrate how you would query a join statement that would get all of a doctors patients from the following collections:

```SQL
CREATE TABLE doctors (
  id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  -- CODE OMITTED
  patientId  INT NOT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (id)
  FOREIGN KEY (patientId)
    REFERENCES patients(id),
)

CREATE TABLE patients (
  id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  -- CODE OMITTED
   doctorId INT NOT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (id)
   FOREIGN KEY (doctorId)
    REFERENCES doctors(id),
)

CREATE TABLE doctors (
  id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  doctorId INT NOT NULL,
  patientId INT NOT NULL,

  FOREIGN KEY (doctorId)
    REFERENCES doctors(id),
  FOREIGN KEY (patientId)
    REFERENCES patients(id),
)

```

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment

today we were learning more about inheritance as well as interfaces. i feel pretty comfortable with inheritance but a little confused with interfaces. with a little more time i dont think it would be that bad.
