## Questions

Write a review and reflection of your experiences in this course, as this is the last lecture before your `final project`, what are your concerns, how do you plan to manage your time, what have you enjoyed most about the course up to this point.

mark is such a great teacher and is so full of energy and great professional lessons. i am going to miss sitting in his lectures. this course has been the hardest thing i have every done but only because i have pushed myself to continue forward. my time after codeworks is going to continue to code as much as possible and my new full time job will be looking for employment. i just want to say a huge thank you to all the staff at codeworks for helping me get to where im at today and it will be a bitter sweet. :(
