# Daily Reflection
This is a stressful week! You are working on a project that closely mimics what you will be expected to accomplish during a standard 40 hour work week. Are you enjoying the struggles? Are you managing your time wisely? 


yes i am enjoying the struggles. as far as time goes im doing everything i can to get this project done and passing. however i still do time box and if i get stuck for too long i will take a break.

## Prompts
