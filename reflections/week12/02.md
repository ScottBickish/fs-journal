# Daily Reflection
Two full days in! Did you make the progress you were hoping for yesterday and today? How are you working? Client -> Server, focusing only on the server for now?  

yes i did i feel i will be ready for a grade tomorrow to see where im at and maybe even pass. i technically finished my server on saturday night and have made a few small changes over the last couple days. the client is going well. 

## Prompts
- How is today going? 

today is going pretty well i got all my routes covered im having a few issues with my delete vaultkeeps and im following the data trying to figure it out. 

- Are you managing your stress?

less today than yesterday because i feel im pretty close to finishing and all my focus is going to this project. 

- What has you most worried?

i know i wont be able to finish the masonry layout. but possibly ui stuff and this vaultkeep delete issue. it always deletes the first vaultkeep in the array regardless of what i click on.
