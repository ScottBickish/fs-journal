# Daily Reflection
Have you started the client? How is you vue application shaping up. Do you have the basics of data rendering to the page.  


yes i have and today i passed the final!!!!!!!!!!! i got graded once this afternoon and missed one thing. harrison had me copy a private vault url and paste it on another account to see if it would push to the home page and it didnt. i had it set up as an @click not as an onmounted. so during typical lunch time i got that to work and worked on a few other ui things in the mean time, got one more grade and passed i feel so great and accomplished.
